# CredCatch - Dump + Leak Scanning 
---

CredCatch is a tool for scanning password dumps for emails in bulk.

After you've got yourself a list of emails generated by PasswordSpraying toolkit, or many of the email generation/gathering tools, run this tool against those emails and it will scrape dump information from WeLeaksInfo using selenium.

If you have a valid account, you can login and get plaintext credentials.

## Usage

```
./CredCatch.rb emails.txt
```

### Configurating BreachCompilation Integration
If you've ever used the BreachCompilation database, you'll know it has some good stuff in it. If you don't have it, you can download it with this magnet link:

```
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:7ffbcd8cee06aba2ce6561688cf68ce2addca0a3&dn=BreachCompilation&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fglotorrents.pw%3A6969&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.opentrackr.org%3A1337
```

Once you've got this saved, you can either specify it's path with the `./CredCatch.rb -b /path/to/breachcompilation`, or `cp settings.json.example settings.json`, and add in your path to settings.json.
